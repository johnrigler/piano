This is a javascript midi piano controller. I have a bit of web3 stuff included since that is how 
I work, but the main body of the piano stuff is in midi.js

It is designed to work with a Donner N25, but you should be able to use it with many keyboards.

It is mostly based on some youtube videos:

This is vanilla javaScript with no drivers! It is super easy to work with.
